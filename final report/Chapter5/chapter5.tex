\chapter{Evaluation}

This chapter will give critical evaluation of the project as a whole along with giving feedback on the various elements that made up the project.

\section{Application}

First of critical evaluation will take place of the application that was developed as part of the project, illustrating the good points and the bad points of the application explaining what was done well within the application and what could do with improvement to make the application better as a whole.

\subsection{Achievements - Good Bits}

This section will talk about bits of the application that were through to have been executed well or were positive parts of the project. It will also discus the parts of the project that the developer was specifically proud of.

\subsubsection{User Feedback}

The overall feedback that was received from the users was very good and gave a good indication that the application was on the right route to becoming and application that users want to use for the various location based messages, Thomas Nicolaides wrote "I think the appliation is a great concept, and it fills a niche that nothing I've found previously has. I definitely would use it when it becomes available to more people." which gives a great idea that the concept is something that users want to use Daniel Jones wrote "{STICK QUOTE IN}" 
\\
This feedback is a great accomplishment and it is great to see the user community is interested in the application as a whole and that it could potentially grow into a application that a lot of people want to use. A large part of general feedback received from showing the application has been fairly positive and people seemed to be very intrigued by the idea and want to see a fully fledged application to try out.

\subsubsection{Database Design}

The developer of the application is very happy with the way the database has been designed and the design created at the very start of the project seems to have exceeded its expectations with very minimal modifications being made to it to make it suit application design as the design has matured and grown into the fully fledged application that we see detailed in this document.\\
\\
The design is very robust and copes well with the growth of the application and it should be very easy to add on new functionality to the database as the application grows and matures to become a production ready application, its simplistically and low coupling should help with other developers understanding how the everything links together.\\
\\
Database functions also help to complete the database part of the application, helping keeping database type tasks segregated from the middle tier application this should intern help with security and performance which are key points to the application that want to be kept robust as possible to help with the stress of users using the application.

\subsubsection{Choice Of Technologies}

For the most part the choice of technology was right, the use of PostgreSQL and HAPI.js/Node.js suited the backend development down to the ground making development fast along with providing the features that were needed to get the job done quickly and effectively.\\
\\
PostgreSQL lived completely up to the developers expectations and gave many more useful features than expected its robustness can not be faulted for this project along with the advanced features offered included integrated JSON parser, advanced database functions along with built in security features with advanced hashing and encryption algorithms which made making the data secure a breeze.\\
\\
HAPI.js and Node.js together made the perfect backend for the application, being extremely flexible and versatile with a great developer community behind them which were raring to help anyone using there API's. Theses frameworks worked perfectly and did everything that was asked of them in well structured and well documented ways which ultimately helped speed up the development of the application and create a better product at the end of it. The stability of the Node.js platform has been excellent as well with very minor issues that stopped the application behaving as intended.

\subsection{Limitations \& Potential improvements - Bad bits}

In this section the limitations of the application and what could be improved will be discussed, it will detail what parts of the application were not up to the standard of the developer.

\subsubsection{Testing}

\subsubsection{Android}

% Talk about phone gapp being the same language and framework as backend...

\subsubsection{Confusing UI}

\subsubsection{Actively Negative}

\subsubsection{Error handling}

\subsubsection{Mapping With Multiple Pins}

\subsubsection{Application Completeness}


\section{Developers performance}

This section will be assessing the developers performance throughout the project, giving critical feedback about what was done well and what could have been done better to make the project better as a whole.

\subsection{Positive - what was done well}

This section will cover in detail what the developer thought what they did well to help with the development of the project and what they were specifically proud of.

\subsubsection{Risk Assessment}

\subsubsection{Priority Assessment}

\subsubsection{Test Community}

\subsubsection{Problem Solving}


\subsection{Negative - what could be improved}

Contained within this section is what the developer thought they could of possibly done better to aid with the development of the project as a whole and ultimately created a better product.
