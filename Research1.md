##Shrtwv:

Anonymous sharing app,

iOS only,

US region only,

Can’t test due to the region locks.

thoughts, photos and activities tied to a specific location.

No social integration is only anonymous.

Mostly used of overheard things in areas.

adoption of 200,000 in beta stage in December 2013 although seems to be dead now

“the porn will come, man, the porn will come” brilliant quote.

##Slight:
	
##Tag:

Facebook login is broken… So can’t really see how social it is.

Looks more like sharing your current location with a picture to people that you want them to know where you are.

Mostly for seeing what friends are up to.

Goal is to bring people together in the real world and show that something is happening near by.

Similar as it only allows the location to be shared if the user wants to.

And it does not implicitly track the user.
		
##Tagged:

Swish UI, very pretty looking application.

SPAMMS the shit out of you…

Nothing like what It say in the description,

Horrible dating site that needs to die in a fire…

##Glympse:

For sharing the location of the user when they are traveling between different places,

Good for meeting up with someone else so they know the other person is in transit.

Share to only people that you want to know where they are.

is much more a tracker than a social app, but nice for conveying location to another person if you are meeting up with them.

I quite like this app as a idea

##Drop Message:
		
quite similar to my idea,

iOS only

More global scope where everyone its posted to can see the 'drop' that you have made,

Seems quite cartoony, 

Theres not much of a link in to social media,

Quite clunky in its layout.

#What is important,

##To the user:

Ability to easily drop a pin and leave a message or a photo.

To easily share it to the people that they want it to and not send it to people they don't want to send it to.

Easy hookin to find other users of the tool.

Accuracy Is somewhat important to the application,

Not be to intrusive should be easy to disable notifications if that is appropriate for the situation.

Should not duplicate notifications.

Should look sum what professional. 

Should not train the battery getting a fix all the time,

Minimal data should be transfered.

##To the developer,

Backend should be as simple as it possibly can be.

We need to compute if there is any near by tags to the user.

Modularity,

Not to tasking for the hardware.

##The essences,

To be able to leave a message on a geo location and for it to be picked up by an desired user and they will be able to act on this data that has been left. Thought a small notification on the phones ui.

### Essential,

UI is not integral to the job that I am trying to archive.

UI can come one i have a simple prototype.

Multiple users can come later.

I want to be able to leave a pin and to be able to retrieve it again, as my first goal dosn't even matter if its hard coded for now.
